### Echo Echo
Ask the user for input on the same line and display that input again on a newline.\

```
Input: This is Echo Echo for C#
Echo: This is Echo Echo for C#
```
Completion:
- NA

### FizzBuzz
Make a program that asks the user for a number (n) and prints out the numbers 1 to n but replaces the number with 'Fizz' when dividable by 3, 'Buzz' when dividable by 5 and 'FizzBuzz' when divisable by both.\
Use functions if applicable
Completion:
- NA

### Calculator
Ask the user for a number, an operator and another number and print out the full equation on a newline.\
The following operators must be usable: + - * / % and if the user gives an invalid input it must terminate the program and display why.\
If the user tries to divide by 0 it must terminate the program and display why.\
Use Try Catches and Switch Cases if applicable.
