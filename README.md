# What is this
This is a series of projects that I will try to solve in as many languages as possible.\
I won't solve every challenge in every language but I will try to.\
I will solve the first challenge (Hello) in every language.\

## The languages
I have chosen these languages based on variety and personal preference.\
The languages are:
- Assembly
- Bash
- Brainfuck
- C
- C#
- C++
- COBOL
- Dart
- Go!
- Haskell
- Haxe
- HolyC
- HTML
- Java
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- Lua
- Markdown
- Perl
- PHP
- PowerShell
- Ruby
- Rust
- Swift
- TypeScript

Though I will most likely reduce the most important ones to:
- C++
- Haxe
- Kotlin
- TypeScript
- PHP
- Python

I must solve a challenge in all these in order to continue to the next.\
I will try to solve for the following languages as well though I will use cross-compilers (Like with Kotlin and Haxe) for these ones\

- C
- C#
- Dart
- Go!
- Java
- JavaScript
- Perl
- Ruby
- Rust
- Swift

## The Challenges
The challenges are as following and I will include the languages I managed to solve the challenge in

### Hello
Print out the phrase 'Hello, X!' followed by a newline. Where X is equal to the program language you're solving for.\
So for Python it needs to print out the phrase 'Hello, Python!' in the terminal.\
For HTML it must display 'Hello, HTML!' in a browser. etc
Completion:
- NA

### Echo Echo
Ask the user for input on the same line and display that input again on a newline.\

```
Input: This is Echo Echo for C#
Echo: This is Echo Echo for C#
```
Completion:
- NA

### FizzBuzz
Make a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 but replaces the number with 'Fizz' when dividable by 3, 'Buzz' when dividable by 5 and 'FizzBuzz' when divisable by both.\
DO NOT HARDCODE.

### Calculator
Ask the user for a number, an operator and another number and print out the full equation on a newline.\
The following operators must be usable: + - * / % and if the user gives an invalid input it must terminate the program and display why.\
If the user tries to divide by 0 it must terminate the program and display why.
