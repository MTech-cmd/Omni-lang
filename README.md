# What is this
This is a series of projects that I will try to solve in as many languages as possible.\

## Categories
I have divided this into different categories which are:
- [Pilot](#pilot)
- [CLI](#cli) 
- [Back-end](#back-end)
- [Front-end](#front-end)
- [Full-stack](#full-stack)
- [Local](#local)
- [Docker](#docker) 
- [2D Gaming](#2d-gaming)
- [3D Gaming](#3d-gaming)

### Pilot
This is a unique category in where I try to basically do Hello World in as many languages and compile it as close to machine code as possible.

### CLI
For the CLI the rules are simple, it must run on a UNIX based system in the command line interface running ZSH.

### Back-end
The back-end must be a server ready application that must be able to connect to a front-end by an API, every challenge here will be linked to its front-end counterpart.\
The back-end must communicate with a MariaDB database and store information.\

### Front-end
The Front-end must be ready to accept any back-ends from the back-end challenges and convert it into a visually appealing front-end.

### Full-stack
Similar to back and front end but for full-stack frameworks.

### DevOps
The point of this category is that some of these projects must be able to be dockerized.\
This is more targeted towards DevOps.\
This is also a list of all the hosting solutions that need to be used

### 2D Gaming
With this category I will try to explore different gaming frameworks and engines.

### 3D Gaming
The same as 2D but with an extra dimension.
